## Tech Stack

### VueJS
 Serves as the client that will consumed the api endpoints from the phoenix framework.
 
### Phoenix 
 Serves as the backend for our app which contains the api endpoints, channels (for realtime updates), and other server side operations.

 Serves as the database for our backend framework. Uses this database since it is supported out of the box by the backend.
